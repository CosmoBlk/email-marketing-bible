## Chapter 5: Copywriting That Converts

Every email you send is competing with 120 others in your subscriber's inbox. The difference between the emails that get opened, read, and acted on and the ones that get deleted without a second thought comes down to one thing: the words you choose.

This chapter covers every layer of email copy, from the subject line that earns the open to the P.S. that clinches the click.

### Subject Lines

Your subject line is the most consequential piece of copy you'll write. 64% of people decide whether to open an email based on the subject line alone, and 45% factor in the sender name. That's it. Your beautifully designed email, your killer offer, your perfectly segmented audience. None of it matters if the subject line doesn't earn the open.

**Length matters more than you'd think.** Subject lines under 25 characters tend to produce the highest open rates. But here's the nuance: lines between 25 and 35 characters tend to produce the highest conversion rates. The sweet spot for balancing both sits around 30 to 50 characters. Why the discrepancy? Shorter lines create curiosity and get opened, but slightly longer ones give enough context that the people who do open are more qualified and more likely to act.

For mobile, keep it under 30 characters if you can. Anything beyond that gets truncated on most phones, and with 60%+ of emails opened on mobile, that truncation point is your hard ceiling for making an impression.

**Be specific, not clever.** Treat your subject line like a newspaper headline, not a riddle. "3 ways to reduce your cart abandonment rate" will almost always outperform "You won't believe this secret." Specificity sets an expectation. Cleverness creates confusion.

Numbers work particularly well. They signal concrete, scannable value. "5 templates for your welcome series" tells the reader exactly what they're getting.

**Personalisation lifts opens by about 14%.** Using a subscriber's first name or referencing their recent behaviour in the subject line creates a pattern interrupt in a crowded inbox. But personalisation only works if the rest of the email delivers on the promise. a subject line that says "George, your custom report is ready" followed by a generic blast is worse than no personalisation at all, because you've broken trust.

**Skip emojis in triggered emails.** Campaign emails can benefit from a well-placed emoji (used sparingly), but data consistently shows that emojis underperform in triggered, automated emails like abandoned cart or browse abandonment sequences. These emails work because they feel personal and relevant. Emojis make them feel like marketing.

**In campaign emails, avoid 'you' and 'your'.** This is counterintuitive. We're taught to write in second person, to make it about the reader. But campaign-level testing shows that subject lines without 'you' and 'your' tend to outperform. The theory is that second person in subject lines triggers the reader's "I'm being sold to" filter. Instead, try framing around the topic: "The welcome series that converts at 40%" rather than "How you can improve your welcome series."

**The Ben Settle approach.** Ben Settle sends a daily email and rarely uses conventional subject lines. His approach is personality-driven curiosity. Short, cryptic, sometimes bizarre. "The vampire method." "What my cat taught me about copywriting." It works because his audience expects it and because each email delivers something genuinely interesting. The lesson isn't to copy his style. It's that subject lines are a contract with your audience, and that contract can take many forms.

**Question vs statement subject lines produce mixed results.** Some audiences respond better to questions ("Is your welcome series broken?"), others to statements ("Your welcome series is probably broken"). Test both for your audience rather than adopting a blanket rule.

**Negative framing can outperform positive framing.** "Don't make this mistake with your email flows" can beat "How to improve your email flows." This taps into loss aversion, a psychological principle we'll cover shortly. People are more motivated to avoid a mistake than to achieve a gain.

**The most famous subject line test of all time:** during the 2008 Obama campaign, the email team tested dozens of subject line variants for fundraising emails. The winner? "Hey." That single word raised $2.5 million more than the next best variant. The campaign raised over $500 million via email in total. The lesson isn't that you should send "Hey" as your subject line. It's that assumptions about what works are often wrong, and the only way to know is to test.

### Preview Text

Preview text (also called preheader text) is the grey text that appears after the subject line in most email clients. It's your subject line's wingman.

Emails with intentional preheader text achieve an average 44.67% open rate, roughly 5 percentage points higher than emails without. That's a meaningful lift for zero extra effort.

Keep your preview text under 50 characters. It should complement the subject line, not repeat it. If your subject line is "3 ways to reduce cart abandonment," your preview text might be "Number 2 surprised our team." Together, they create a complete pitch for opening.

If you leave the preview text blank, email clients will pull the first text they can find in your email body. Usually that's "View this email in your browser" or an image alt tag. It looks sloppy and wastes prime real estate.

Write your subject line and preview text as a pair, not as an afterthought.

**Technically, preview text goes in a hidden span or div at the very top of your email HTML, before any visible content.** Some ESPs provide a dedicated preview text field, which makes this easier. If yours doesn't, you'll need to add it manually. A common technique is to follow your preview text with a string of zero-width spaces and non-breaking spaces. This pads the preview so email clients don't pull in additional body text after your intended preview.

**Different email clients display different preview text lengths.** Gmail shows about 90 characters on desktop but only about 40 on mobile. Apple Mail on iPhone shows roughly 90 characters. Outlook on desktop is generous at around 50 to 100 depending on the version. The safe approach is to front-load your key message in the first 40 characters and treat anything beyond that as a bonus.

### Body Copy Structure

You've earned the open. Now you have about 8 seconds before the reader decides whether to keep going or hit delete.

**Put the most important thing first.** The inverted pyramid structure from journalism works beautifully in email. Lead with the key message or the most compelling hook, then provide supporting detail, then close with your call to action. Don't build up to the point. Start with it.

**Short paragraphs. One idea per paragraph.** In email, a paragraph is one to three sentences. sometimes just one word. Your reader is scanning, not settling in for a novel. White space between paragraphs gives the eye places to rest and makes the email feel faster to read.

**Laura Belgray puts it perfectly: read like a person, not a brand.** Use "I" instead of "we" whenever possible. Write the way you'd talk to a friend who happens to be interested in your topic. This doesn't mean being unprofessional. It means being human. The brands and creators with the highest engagement rates are almost always the ones who sound like actual people.

**Positive language increases conversion by about 22%.** This doesn't mean avoiding problems or pain points (PAS framework, coming shortly, is built on exactly that). It means the overall tone of your email should leave the reader feeling capable and optimistic. Frame your CTA around what they'll gain, not what they'll lose.

**Drip email sequences massively outperform one-off sends.** Drip emails see 80% higher open rates and 3x more clicks than single sends. This makes sense. A well-constructed sequence builds context, trust, and momentum. Each email earns the next open. We covered flow design in Chapter 4, but the copy lesson is clear: think in sequences, not single emails.

**Read your email out loud before sending.** This is the simplest and most effective editing technique I know. If you stumble over a sentence when reading aloud, rewrite it. If you sound like a press release, rewrite it. If you wouldn't say it to someone sitting across from you at a coffee shop, rewrite it. Reading aloud catches awkward phrasing, overly long sentences, and tone mismatches that silent reading misses.

**Write your email, then cut it by 30%.** First drafts are almost always too long. Go through and remove every sentence that doesn't directly support your main point or move the reader toward your CTA. Remove qualifiers ("very," "really," "quite"). Remove throat-clearing openings ("I wanted to reach out to let you know that..."). Get to the point faster than feels comfortable. Your readers will thank you with their clicks.

**The 'one reader' rule.** Write every email as if it's going to exactly one person. Not your list of 50,000. One person. Give that person a name if it helps. This mindset shift changes everything: your tone becomes more conversational, your examples become more specific, and your CTAs become more direct. Mass emails that feel personal outperform personal-feeling emails that read like mass communication.

### Copywriting Frameworks

Frameworks give you a starting structure so you're never staring at a blank page. Here are seven that I use and recommend, each suited to different situations.

**AIDA: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action**

The classic. Grab attention with a strong opening line, build interest with relevant information, create desire by connecting features to benefits, and close with a clear action step. AIDA works best for promotional emails where you're introducing an offer.

Example opening: "We just shipped the feature your support tickets have been asking for." That's your attention. Then interest: what the feature does. Then desire: what it means for the reader. Then action: try it now.

AIDA works well because it mirrors how people naturally process a decision. You notice something, you get curious, you want it, you act. The framework simply structures your email to match that process. The main risk with AIDA is spending too long on Attention and Interest without getting to the action. In email, you have limited attention. Move through the stages quickly.

**PAS: Problem, Agitate, Solution**

Name the problem your reader faces. Agitate it by making them feel the frustration, the cost, the pain of leaving it unsolved. Then present your solution. PAS is the most reliable framework for cold email and B2B, because it demonstrates that you understand the reader's world before you pitch.

Example: "Your welcome series converts at 2%. (Problem.) That means for every 1,000 new subscribers, 980 never buy. Over a year, that's tens of thousands in lost revenue from people who wanted to hear from you. (Agitate.) Here's a 5-email welcome structure that consistently converts at 8-12%. (Solution.)"

**BAB: Before, After, Bridge**

Show the current state (before), paint the desired state (after), then position your product or service as the bridge between the two. BAB works brilliantly for case study emails and transformation stories.

Example: "Before: spending 15 hours a week on email marketing, manually segmenting lists, guessing at send times. After: automated flows generating 30% of total revenue, freeing up 12 hours a week. Bridge: here's exactly how [Client] set it up."

**4Ps: Promise, Picture, Proof, Push**

Promise a specific benefit. Paint a vivid picture of what life looks like with that benefit. Prove it with evidence (data, testimonials, case studies). Push to action with a clear CTA. The 4Ps framework works well for mid-funnel emails where trust is building but not yet established.

Example: "Promise: Get your first 100 subscribers in 30 days. Picture: Imagine waking up to new sign-ups every morning, people who want to hear from you. Proof: Sarah used this exact method and hit 100 subscribers in 22 days (here's her full breakdown). Push: Download the 30-day plan now."

**Star-Story-Solution**

Introduce a character (the star), tell their story (ideally one your reader relates to), and reveal your product as the solution. This framework excels in nurture sequences where you're building connection over time. The star can be a customer, yourself, or even the reader.

The power of Star-Story-Solution is that it doesn't feel like marketing. It reads like a story with a point. The reader gets emotionally invested in the star's journey, and by the time you present the solution, they're already leaning forward. Use this framework for customer case studies, founder stories, and any email where you want the reader to see themselves in someone else's experience.

**The Soap Opera Sequence (Andre Chaperon)**

This is the most sophisticated email framework I know, and the one worth studying if you're serious about email copywriting. Andre Chaperon developed it to create multi-email narratives that use cliffhangers and open loops to keep subscribers reading.

The structure across a sequence:

1. **Set the stage.** Introduce the setting, the character, the situation. End with a hook that makes the reader need to open the next email.
2. **Backstory.** Fill in context. How did this situation come to be? End with another open loop.
3. **The turning point.** Something changed. A discovery, a failure, a breakthrough. This is where tension peaks.
4. **The hidden benefit.** Reveal something unexpected. The solution that emerged from the turning point, and why it matters for the reader.
5. **Urgency and CTA.** Close the narrative loop and present the offer with genuine urgency.

Each email opens a loop that the next one closes, while simultaneously opening a new loop. It's addictive to read, and the engagement data reflects it. Chaperon's sequences regularly achieve 70%+ open rates deep into a sequence, where most marketers see steep drop-off after email two.

**The 1-3-1 Newsletter Structure**

For regular newsletters, this structure keeps things tight: one big story or insight (your main piece), three shorter items (links, tips, observations), and one closing thought or CTA. It gives the reader variety while maintaining a clear focal point. Most successful paid newsletters use some variation of this.

The beauty of 1-3-1 is that it respects the reader's time while giving them enough variety to find something relevant. If the main story doesn't resonate, one of the three shorter items might. The closing CTA brings focus back to a single action. it's a structure that feels generous without being overwhelming.

**Choosing the Right Framework**

No single framework is best for all situations. Here's how I'd match them:

Promotional emails and product launches: AIDA or 4Ps. Welcome sequences: PAS or Commitment-building micro-CTA emails. Case studies and testimonials: BAB or Star-Story-Solution. Multi-email nurture sequences: Soap Opera Sequence. Regular newsletters: 1-3-1. Cold email and outbound: PAS.

The framework is a starting structure. Once you've written with a framework for long enough, you'll start blending elements naturally. A PAS email with a Star-Story structure for the agitate section. An AIDA email with social proof woven through the interest section. That's when frameworks go from helpful to invisible.

### The Psychology Behind Email Copy

Good email copy isn't just well-written. It's built on an understanding of how people make decisions. Here are the psychological principles that underpin the best email marketing.

**The Curiosity Gap (George Loewenstein)**

Loewenstein's information gap theory says that curiosity arises when we perceive a gap between what we know and what we want to know. Subject lines, open loops, and cliffhangers all exploit this gap. "The subject line strategy that increased our opens by 40%" creates a gap. Your brain wants to close it. The key is to always deliver on the other side. Creating a curiosity gap and then failing to satisfy it trains subscribers to stop opening.

**Loss Aversion (Kahneman and Tversky)**

People feel losses roughly twice as intensely as equivalent gains. This is one of the most well-documented findings in behavioural economics, and it has direct implications for email copy. "Don't miss out on 20% off" is psychologically stronger than "Get 20% off." "Don't let your trial expire" outperforms "Renew your trial." Use loss framing strategically, particularly for re-engagement, expiry, and abandonment emails.

**Narrative Transportation**

When readers become absorbed in a story, their resistance to persuasion drops significantly. This is why the Soap Opera Sequence works so well. When someone is transported into a narrative, they're less likely to counter-argue or dismiss the eventual pitch. They're emotionally invested. The practical takeaway: tell more stories in your emails. Customer stories, your own stories, hypothetical scenarios. Stories lower the drawbridge.

**Commitment and Consistency (Robert Cialdini)**

Once someone takes a small action, they're significantly more likely to take a larger, consistent action. This is why welcome sequences that ask for micro-commitments (reply to this email, set a preference, download a free resource) produce higher eventual conversion rates. each small 'yes' primes the subscriber for the bigger 'yes' of purchasing. Structure your early emails to invite easy, low-stakes actions.

**Social Proof**

"Join 50,000 marketers who read this newsletter" works because it triggers a belonging need and provides evidence of value. If 50,000 people find this worth their time, it's probably worth mine. Social proof is most effective when it's specific (exact numbers, named companies, real testimonials with full names) and when the reference group is one the reader identifies with.

**The Zeigarnik Effect**

People remember uncompleted tasks more vividly than completed ones. This is the psychological engine behind open loops and cliffhangers. When you end an email mid-story ("I'll tell you what happened next in tomorrow's email"), the reader's brain flags it as unfinished business. It nags at them. They're primed to open the next email because their brain wants closure.

Practically, the Zeigarnik Effect explains why TV shows end on cliffhangers and why Andre Chaperon's Soap Opera Sequence is so effective. But you don't need a multi-email sequence to use it. Even within a single email, opening a loop early ("I'll explain why this matters at the end") keeps the reader scrolling.

**Scarcity: Real vs Fake**

Genuine scarcity works. Limited-time offers, limited-stock products, enrollment windows that actually close. these create real urgency and motivate action.

Fake scarcity destroys trust. Countdown timers that reset when you revisit the page. "Only 2 left!" on a digital product. "Doors closing forever!" when they reopen every quarter. Subscribers talk. They screenshot. They notice. And once they catch you manufacturing urgency, every future claim you make is suspect. Only ever use scarcity you can stand behind honestly.

### CTAs That Work

Your call to action is where everything either converts or doesn't. After all the work of earning the open, hooking the reader, and building desire, the CTA is the moment of truth.

**Buttons outperform text links by about 27% in click-through rate.** The reason is simple: buttons are visually distinct, obviously clickable, and easy to tap on mobile. That said, text links within body copy can feel more natural in text-heavy, personal-style emails. The best approach for many emails is to include both.

**A single CTA produces 42% more clicks than multiple CTAs.** Every additional choice you give the reader dilutes the power of each option. When possible, commit to one action you want the reader to take, and build your entire email around it.

**Specific button text massively outperforms generic text.** "Get my 20% discount" beats "Shop now." "Download the template" beats "Click here." "Start my free trial" beats "Learn more." Specificity tells the reader exactly what will happen when they click, which reduces friction and increases confidence.

**Chris Orzechowski teaches that your CTA should be the natural conclusion of your email's argument.** If your email has done its job, the reader should arrive at the CTA and think, "Obviously." The CTA isn't a pivot. It's a destination the email has been walking toward the entire time.

**Place your CTA both above the fold and below the main content.** This dual placement produces roughly 35% more total clicks than a single CTA placement. Some readers are ready to act immediately. Others need to read the full email first. Serve both.

**For cold email, interest-based CTAs massively outperform meeting requests.** "Worth exploring?" or "Is this on your radar?" gets 2 to 3 times more replies than "Can we schedule a 15-minute call?" The softer ask reduces the perceived commitment and lowers the bar for response.

**CTA colour matters, but not in the way most people think.** There's no universally "best" button colour. What matters is contrast. Your CTA button should be the most visually prominent element in your email. If your email uses blue throughout, a blue CTA button disappears. An orange or green button in the same email pops. Test colours, but test them in context, not in isolation.

**First-person CTA copy consistently outperforms second-person.** "Start my free trial" beats "Start your free trial." "Get my discount" beats "Get your discount." The theory is that first-person copy creates a sense of ownership before the click. The reader is mentally claiming the offer rather than being told about it. Multiple A/B tests across different industries confirm this pattern, with lifts typically in the 25 to 35% range.

### The P.S. Line

The P.S. is one of the most-read parts of any email. Eye-tracking studies consistently show that readers scan from the top, skip to the bottom, and then decide whether to read the middle. Your P.S. catches the scanners.

Use the P.S. for one of three purposes: reinforcing your main CTA with a different angle, adding a secondary offer or piece of information, or injecting personality. Some of the best email marketers use the P.S. exclusively for personal, off-topic asides that build connection.

One marketer I follow shared this: "I added a plain-text P.S. to every email with a personal note. CTR went up 22%." That's not a controlled study, but it aligns with what I've seen. The P.S. humanises an email. It says, "Hey, I'm still here. This isn't a bot."

Add a P.S. to every promotional and newsletter email you send. It costs nothing and consistently lifts performance.

**P.S. best practices:** Keep it to one or two sentences. Don't bury critical information in the P.S. that belongs in the body. Use it as a second chance to make your case, not as a dumping ground for things you forgot to include. And make the P.S. sound distinctly different from the rest of the email. If the body is polished and professional, let the P.S. be casual and personal. If the body tells a story, let the P.S. deliver the punchline.

Some marketers use the P.S. as a running feature. A weekly personal update, a book recommendation, a random observation. Subscribers start looking forward to the P.S. specifically, which means they're scrolling past your CTA to get to it. That's a good problem to have.

### Plain Text vs HTML

This is one of the most under-discussed decisions in email marketing.

**Plain text tends to outperform in B2B, personal brands, and relationship-driven businesses.** When your email looks like it was typed by a person and sent to one person, it gets treated differently. It lands in the Primary tab more often. It gets replied to more. It feels like correspondence, not marketing.

HubSpot ran tests and found that HTML emails with images actually decreased click-through rates compared to plain text versions. The designed emails looked polished, but the plain ones got more clicks.

**Designed emails outperform for ecommerce**, where product images are essential to the buying decision. You can't sell a dress without showing the dress. If your email needs to showcase visual products, you need HTML.

**The 'designed plain text' hybrid is where many smart marketers land.** A clean template with minimal branding, primarily text-based, with perhaps a logo in the header and a styled CTA button. It looks intentional but doesn't trigger the "this is marketing" filter in the reader's brain. This is the right approach for most SaaS, education, and service businesses.

**Heavy HTML triggers spam filters and the Gmail Promotions tab.** The more images, the more complex your HTML, the more likely your email ends up in Promotions rather than Primary. If inbox placement matters to you (it should), simpler is better.

**Testing format across your flows.** I'd suggest testing plain text vs HTML in at least three contexts: your welcome email (first impression, sets the tone), your best-performing promotional template (where you have the most data), and your abandoned cart first email (where personal feel matters most). You might find that different flows benefit from different formats. Your welcome email might perform better as plain text (warm, personal), while your promotional emails perform better with product images. That's fine. Format isn't a global decision. It's a per-flow decision.

**The text-to-link ratio.** Regardless of format, be careful about the number of links in your email. Emails with excessive links (more than 5 to 7 unique links in a short email) can trigger spam filters and, more importantly, dilute your click data. Every link is a choice, and choices create friction. Keep your link count proportional to your email length, and ensure every link serves a clear purpose.

The fundamental principle: your email's format should match the relationship you're trying to build. If you're the trusted advisor, write like one. If you're the premium retailer, design like one.

## Chapter 6: Design and Technical

Email design in 2026 is a strange discipline. You're designing for a medium that renders differently across dozens of email clients, on screens ranging from smartwatches to ultrawide monitors, in both light and dark mode, with technology constraints that would make a web developer weep. And yet, the emails that perform best are often the simplest.

This chapter covers the technical foundations that make your emails display correctly, load quickly, and convert reliably.

### Mobile-First Design

Over 60% of emails are now opened on mobile devices. That number has been climbing steadily for years, and it's not coming back down. More critically, 64% of mobile users will delete an email that doesn't display well on their phone. That's not "doesn't look perfect." That's "doesn't work."

Mobile-first means designing for the smallest screen first, then scaling up.

**Single-column layouts are the safest and most effective approach.** Multi-column designs that look great on desktop collapse unpredictably on mobile, often stacking in the wrong order or creating side-scrolling nightmares. A single column with properly sized text, images, and buttons works everywhere.

**Keep your email width between 600 and 640 pixels.** This is the standard that works across the widest range of email clients. Wider than 640px and you risk horizontal scrolling on smaller screens and in email clients that add sidebar panels.

**Touch-friendly buttons must be at least 44x44 pixels.** This is Apple's Human Interface Guideline for minimum tap targets, and I'd actually suggest going slightly larger, to 46x46 pixels, to account for less precise tapping. Nothing kills mobile email engagement faster than a button that's too small to tap accurately.

**Font sizes should be 13px minimum on iPhone.** Anything smaller than 13px on iOS triggers auto-zoom, which breaks your layout. Use 14-16px for body text and 20-22px for headlines. Larger is almost always better on mobile.

**Subject lines should stay under 30 characters for mobile visibility.** Most mobile email clients truncate subject lines between 30 and 40 characters depending on the device and whether preview text is shown. Front-load the important words.

**Use media queries for mobile-optimised images.** Serve smaller image files to mobile devices, both for load speed and data usage. An image that loads in 1 second on wifi might take 5 seconds on a poor mobile connection, and your reader won't wait.

**Image file size matters more than most marketers realise.** Keep individual images under 200KB and total email weight under 800KB. Compress all images before uploading. Use TinyPNG or Squoosh for lossless compression. Many ESPs will resize images on the fly, but they don't always compress them aggressively enough.

**Use web-safe fonts as your primary stack.** Custom fonts in email have inconsistent support. Arial, Helvetica, Georgia, and Verdana render reliably everywhere. You can specify a custom web font as your first choice and fall back to a web-safe font for clients that don't support it, but know that the majority of your readers will see the fallback. Design with the fallback in mind, not the custom font.

**Preview your email on actual devices, not just in your browser.** Desktop browser previews are misleading. The email that looks perfect in your Chrome preview might have overlapping text on an iPhone SE or cropped images in the Gmail app on Android. Use Litmus, Email on Acid, or at minimum send yourself a test and check it on your phone before hitting send.

**Retina and high-DPI displays require 2x images.** If your email column is 600px wide and you use a 600px-wide image, it'll look blurry on retina screens (which is most modern phones and laptops). Export images at 2x the display size (1200px for a 600px column) and set the width in HTML to the display size. The file will be larger, so compression becomes even more important.

### Email Client Compatibility

Here is the uncomfortable truth about email development: you're still building with tables. In 2026. While the web has moved on to CSS Grid and Flexbox, email remains anchored to HTML tables for layout.

Why? Because Microsoft Outlook uses Word's rendering engine (yes, the word processor) to display HTML emails. And Outlook holds enough market share, particularly in B2B, that you can't ignore it. Tables render consistently in Word's engine. Modern CSS does not.

**Use inline CSS.** Most email clients strip external stylesheets and many strip styles from the `<head>`. The only reliable way to ensure your styles apply is to inline them directly on each element. Every serious email build tool handles this automatically during export.

**Responsive design using media queries** works in most modern email clients: Apple Mail, iOS Mail, Gmail app, Outlook mobile, Yahoo. The notable exception is Gmail's desktop web client, which has historically had limited support. This is where hybrid design comes in.

**Hybrid design (also called spongy design) is your fallback.** It uses fluid tables, percentage-based widths, and conditional comments to create emails that adapt to screen size without relying on media queries. The email looks good at any width because the underlying structure is flexible by default.

**Mark Robbins has pioneered CSS-only techniques for email** that push what's possible without JavaScript (which is blocked in all email clients). His work on CSS-only interactive components, accessibility improvements, and progressive enhancement has advanced the field considerably. If you're building emails at a technical level, study his work.

**Common email client rendering differences to test for:**

Outlook desktop (2019/2021/365) uses Word's rendering engine, which means no support for CSS background images, limited padding control, and unpredictable table spacing. Use VML (Vector Markup Language) for background images in Outlook. Yes, it's archaic. Yes, it works.

Gmail web strips all styles from the `<head>` if they exceed a certain size threshold (roughly 8,192 characters). If your CSS is complex, some styles will be silently removed. Gmail also doesn't support media queries in its web client, which is why hybrid design matters.

Apple Mail is the most standards-compliant email client and supports nearly everything, including media queries, CSS animations, and `@supports`. It's the dream client to develop for, but don't let it fool you into thinking other clients will behave the same way.

Yahoo Mail and AOL have improved significantly in recent years but still have quirks around media query support and margin handling. always test.

### Email Design Tools

The tooling ecosystem for email design has matured significantly. Here's what I'd recommend in 2026, broken down by use case.

| Tool | Type | Best For | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|---|
| Beefree (BEE) | No-code builder | Marketing teams | Drag-and-drop, saved modules |
| Stripo | No-code + code | Teams needing AMP | AMP for Email, 1,400+ templates |
| Chamaileon | Collaborative | Enterprise teams | Brand governance, approval workflows |
| Litmus | Testing + building | QA-focused teams | 90+ email client previews |
| Email on Acid | Testing | Budget-conscious teams | Client rendering + spam testing |
| MJML | Code framework | Developers | Responsive email markup language |
| Maizzle | Code framework | Tailwind CSS devs | Tailwind for email, build pipeline |
| React Email | Code framework | React developers | Component-based, npm ecosystem |
| Parcel | Code IDE | Email developers | Real-time preview, CSS support hints |
| Figma to Email | Workflow | Design teams | Design in Figma, export to HTML |

Let me break these down with more context.

**No-code builders for marketing teams:**

Beefree (formerly BEE) is my top recommendation for teams that need to build emails quickly without coding. The drag-and-drop interface is genuinely good, and the saved modules feature lets you build a library of reusable components. Stripo is the best option if you need AMP for Email support or want access to a massive template library (1,400+ templates). Chamaileon is built for enterprise teams that need brand governance and approval workflows baked into the email creation process.

**Testing platforms:**

Litmus remains the gold standard, offering previews across 90+ email client and device combinations. It's not cheap, but if you're sending to a diverse audience (and you probably are), seeing how your email renders in Outlook 2019 on Windows vs Apple Mail on macOS vs Gmail on Android is essential. Email on Acid offers similar rendering previews plus spam testing at a lower price point. For teams on a budget, it's a strong alternative.

**Code frameworks for developers:**

MJML is a markup language that compiles to responsive HTML email. You write clean, semantic markup and MJML handles the ugly table-based output. It's the most popular developer framework for email. Maizzle brings Tailwind CSS to email development, with a build pipeline that handles inlining, purging unused CSS, and generating production-ready HTML. React Email lets you build email templates using React components within the npm ecosystem. If your team already thinks in components, this is a natural fit. Parcel (not the web bundler, the email IDE) provides real-time preview and CSS support hints as you code.

**Design-to-code workflows:**

Figma to Email workflows are increasingly common. Design teams create email templates in Figma using component libraries, then export to HTML either through plugins or by handing designs to developers who implement them in MJML or Maizzle.

### No-Code vs Coded Templates

This isn't an either-or decision. It's about matching the approach to the use case.

**No-code tools are 3 to 5 times faster for one-off campaigns.** When you need to build a single promotional email, a drag-and-drop builder gets you there in 30 minutes instead of 3 hours. Use Beefree, Stripo, or your ESP's built-in builder.

**Coded templates are better for recurring flows, version control, and design systems.** When you're building a welcome series that will send to thousands of subscribers for months or years, investing in a properly coded template pays for itself. Coded templates can live in version control (Git), be reviewed in pull requests, and be updated systematically across an entire flow.

**Most mature email programmes use both.** Coded templates for automated flows (welcome, abandoned cart, post-purchase) and no-code tools for one-off campaigns (product launches, seasonal promotions, announcements). This hybrid approach gives you consistency where it matters and speed where you need it.

### Email Template Design Systems

If you're sending more than a handful of email types, you need a design system. Not a template. A system.

**Brand tokens** define the constants: your primary and secondary colours, font stack, standard spacing units (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px), border radius for buttons, and any other visual constants. Document these once and reference them everywhere.

**A component library** contains the building blocks: header (logo, navigation), hero section (image, headline, CTA), text block (heading, body, link), product card (image, title, price, button), CTA button (primary, secondary, text link), and footer (social links, legal text, unsubscribe). Each component has defined responsive behaviour, dark mode treatment, and accessibility requirements.

**Layout templates** combine components into standard email types: promotional email, newsletter, transactional notification, welcome email, abandoned cart. These are your starting points, not your constraints.

**Usage guidelines** tell your team when to use what, how much copy to include, which components are required (footer, unsubscribe) versus optional, and any brand rules around imagery, tone, or CTA placement.

Building a design system takes time upfront. For a typical ecommerce brand, expect 40 to 60 hours of initial development work. But that investment pays back quickly. Once the system is in place, building a new email goes from 3 to 4 hours down to 30 to 60 minutes. And every email you send is automatically on-brand and accessible.

If you're a smaller team without the resources for a full design system, start with a single well-built master template that covers your most common email type (usually a promotional email). Build it properly once, with dark mode support, accessibility features, and mobile optimisation. Then adapt it for each send. That's not a design system, but it solves 80% of the problem.

### Accessibility

Paul Airy has been the leading voice on email accessibility for years, and his core message is worth repeating: accessible emails aren't just the right thing to do, they perform better for everyone.

An estimated 15 to 20% of people have some form of disability. That includes visual impairments, motor disabilities, cognitive differences, and situational disabilities (like reading an email one-handed while holding a baby). Designing for accessibility means designing for all of them, and in the process, you make the email better for the other 80% too.

**WCAG 2.1 requirements for email:**

Colour contrast must meet a 4.5:1 ratio for normal text and 3:1 for large text. Use a contrast checker tool. What looks fine on your high-end monitor might be illegible on a cheaper screen in bright sunlight.

All images must have descriptive alt text. Not "image1.jpg" or "banner." Describe what the image shows and what the reader needs to know. If the image is purely decorative, use an empty alt attribute (alt="") so screen readers skip it.

Maintain a logical reading order. Screen readers follow the HTML source order, not the visual layout. Make sure your content makes sense when read linearly, top to bottom.

Include a language attribute (lang="en") on your HTML element so screen readers use the correct pronunciation model.

Links should have clear purpose from their text alone. "Click here" is meaningless out of context. "Download the 2026 Email Benchmarks Report" tells the reader exactly where the link goes.

Don't rely on colour alone to convey information. If a price is shown in red to indicate a sale, also include text saying "Sale price" or use a strikethrough on the original price.

Use scalable text. Never set font sizes in pixels that can't be overridden by user preferences.

Ensure keyboard navigability. All interactive elements should be reachable and operable via keyboard.

**On layout tables, add role="presentation"** to tell screen readers that the table is used for layout, not data. Without this attribute, screen readers will try to parse your layout as a data table, creating a confusing experience.

**Touch targets of 44x44px minimum** aren't just a mobile best practice. They're an accessibility requirement. Users with motor impairments need adequate target size.

**Accessibility isn't a checklist you complete once.** It's a practice you maintain across every email. Add accessibility review to your email QA process. Before every send, check: does every image have alt text? Is the reading order logical? Do all buttons and links have sufficient size and contrast? Can you understand the email if you squint and can only read the headings and link text? If the answer to any of these is no, fix it before sending.

**Screen reader testing is the gold standard.** If you want to truly understand how accessible your emails are, test them with an actual screen reader. VoiceOver on Mac and iOS, NVDA on Windows, and TalkBack on Android are all free. Listening to your email read aloud by a screen reader will reveal issues that visual inspection never will. Aim to do this at least once per quarter on your most-used templates.

### Dark Mode

At least 33% of email recipients view emails in dark mode, and that percentage is growing. Dark mode can wreak havoc on email designs that weren't built to handle it.

Email clients handle dark mode differently. Some invert colours. Some swap backgrounds. Some do both. The result can be black text on a black background (invisible), dark blue links on a dark grey background (nearly invisible), or logos with white backgrounds that now have a jarring white rectangle around them.

**Test your emails in dark mode across Apple Mail, Gmail, and Outlook.** These three handle dark mode differently, and together they cover the majority of dark mode users.

**Use transparent PNGs for logos.** A logo with a white background on a white email looks fine. That same logo in dark mode gets a white rectangle around it. Transparent backgrounds solve this.

**Avoid pure white backgrounds.** Use off-white (#F5F5F5 or similar) for your email body background. In dark mode, pure white (#FFFFFF) can create a blinding flash. Off-white adapts more gracefully and is easier on the eyes in both modes.

**Use the CSS media query `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` where supported** to provide explicit dark mode styles. This gives you control over how your email appears in dark mode rather than letting the email client guess. Support is good in Apple Mail and Outlook. Gmail ignores it and applies its own dark mode transformations.

**Practical dark mode design tips:**

Use a border or subtle shadow around images with white or light backgrounds so they don't float in dark mode. Add a thin 1px border in your brand colour around logos as a safety measure.

For text colours, avoid pure black (#000000) text in light mode. Use dark grey (#333333 or #222222) instead. In dark mode, email clients often invert pure black to pure white, which can look harsh. Slightly off-black text inverts to slightly off-white, which is easier to read.

Test your CTA buttons in both modes. A button that's highly visible on a white background might disappear on a dark background. Consider adding a border to your buttons so they remain visible regardless of the background colour.

If you're using background colours in content sections (like a highlighted tip box or a coloured banner), those colours may be changed or removed in dark mode. Always ensure your content is readable even if the background colour reverts to the email client's default dark background.

### Interactive Email

Interactive elements in email can significantly boost engagement. Click-to-open rates increase by an average of 31.7% when interactive elements are included.

But interactivity in email comes with a critical caveat: support varies wildly across email clients. Always build with progressive enhancement in mind, a concept Jason Rodriguez has championed. Your interactive element is a bonus for clients that support it. The fallback for clients that don't should still be a fully functional, good-looking email.

**CSS hover effects have broad support and deliver a 5 to 10% uplift in engagement.** Simple things like button colour changes on hover, image overlays, or underline animations. These are low-risk, high-reward additions.

**CSS-powered accordions have moderate support and can deliver 10 to 15% uplift.** They work well for content-heavy emails like newsletters or product comparisons, letting the reader expand only the sections they care about. They don't work in Gmail web or Outlook, so your fallback should show all content expanded.

**Animated GIFs have universal support and deliver 5 to 8% more engagement.** Every email client supports GIFs (with the exception of some Outlook desktop versions, which show only the first frame). they're the safest interactive element you can use. Product demonstrations, subtle animations, and visual interest all work well.

**AMP for Email offers the most powerful interactivity** with 20 to 30% engagement uplift, allowing carousels, forms, accordion menus, and even live content within the email. But support is limited to Gmail and Yahoo, it requires Google sender registration, and adoption remains low. If your audience is primarily on Gmail and you have developer resources, AMP can be powerful. For most senders, it's not worth the investment yet.

**Countdown timers** are a common interactive element for sale emails and limited-time offers. They're generated server-side as animated GIFs that display a live countdown. Services like Sendtric and Mailmodo offer free and paid countdown timer generators. They work in virtually every email client. The important caveat: only use real countdown timers for real deadlines. A timer counting down to a sale that quietly extends afterward trains subscribers to ignore your urgency.

**Embedded surveys and polls** can boost engagement significantly because they turn the email from a broadcast into a conversation. Tools like Typeform and SurveyMonkey generate embeddable one-question polls that work in most email clients. For clients that don't support the embedded version, the fallback is a link to the survey. even a single-question poll in a newsletter can increase click rates by 15 to 20%.

**The golden rule of interactive email: always build the fallback first.** Design your email as if no interactive elements will work. Then layer interactivity on top for the clients that support it. This way, every subscriber gets a functional email, and those with modern email clients get something extra.

## Chapter 7: Deliverability

You can write the most compelling email in the world, segment your list perfectly, and design a flawless template. None of it matters if your email lands in spam.

Deliverability is the foundation that everything else sits on. And in 2026, it's more complex, more engagement-driven, and more consequential than ever before. This chapter is the most detailed in the book because deliverability problems are the silent killer of email programmes. You often don't know you have a problem until revenue has already dropped.

### Authentication: The Non-Negotiable Setup

Email authentication is table stakes. Without proper authentication, inbox providers have no way to verify that you are who you claim to be, and they will treat your emails accordingly.

There are three core authentication protocols. All three are required.

**SPF: Sender Policy Framework**

SPF tells receiving mail servers which servers are authorised to send email on behalf of your domain. It works by publishing a DNS TXT record that lists your authorised sending IPs and includes statements for your ESP.

The critical technical detail most people miss: **SPF has a 10 DNS lookup limit.** Every `include:` statement counts as a lookup, and each of those includes can contain nested lookups of their own. If you're using multiple ESPs (your marketing platform, your transactional email service, your CRM, your helpdesk), you can easily exceed this limit. When you do, SPF fails entirely.

Use `ip4:` directives for your own dedicated sending IPs and `include:` for ESP authorisation. For example: `v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.1 include:_spf.google.com include:sendgrid.net -all`

**Always end your SPF record with `-all` (hard fail), not `~all` (soft fail).** Hard fail tells receiving servers to reject email from unauthorised sources. Soft fail suggests they mark it as suspicious but still deliver it. With DMARC in place (covered below), hard fail is the correct choice.

**SPF flattening** is a technique for complex setups where you're hitting the 10-lookup limit. It resolves all the include statements into their underlying IP addresses and lists them directly in your SPF record. Tools like AutoSPF and SPF Wizard can automate this, but be aware that the flattened record needs updating whenever your ESPs change their sending IPs.

**DKIM: DomainKeys Identified Mail**

DKIM adds a digital signature to every email you send. The receiving server checks this signature against a public key published in your DNS. If the signature matches, the email hasn't been tampered with in transit.

The current standard is **2048-bit RSA keys.** Some older setups still use 1024-bit, which is increasingly insufficient. Rotate your DKIM keys annually. This limits the exposure window if a key is somehow compromised.

The `d=` signing domain must align with your From address domain for DMARC to pass. If your From address is hello@yourbrand.com, your DKIM signature should use d=yourbrand.com (or a subdomain of it, under relaxed alignment).

Use `c=relaxed/relaxed` for your canonicalisation settings. This allows minor, harmless modifications during mail transport (like whitespace changes) without breaking the signature.

**DMARC: Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance**

DMARC ties SPF and DKIM together and tells receiving servers what to do when authentication fails. It's the policy layer.

Only 34% of the largest 5,000 companies have implemented DMARC. Of those that have, 75 to 80% face challenges achieving enforcement (p=quarantine or p=reject). This means the majority of large organisations either lack DMARC entirely or have it set to monitoring mode with no enforcement.

**Implement DMARC in stages:**

Start with `p=none` (monitoring only). This sends you reports about authentication failures without affecting delivery. Leave it in monitoring mode for at least 2 to 4 weeks, analysing the reports to identify any legitimate sending sources that aren't properly authenticated.

Move to `p=quarantine` (failed emails go to spam). This is your first enforcement step. Monitor for any unexpected quarantining of legitimate emails.

Finally, move to `p=reject` (failed emails are outright rejected). This is full enforcement and your end goal.

**DMARC alignment can be relaxed or strict.** Relaxed alignment requires that the organisational domain matches. So mail.yourbrand.com and yourbrand.com would both pass. Strict alignment requires an exact domain match. Most setups need relaxed alignment for multi-ESP compatibility, and that's where you should start unless you have a specific reason for strict alignment.

Matthew Vernhout has been one of the strongest advocates for DMARC adoption, and his guidance on phased implementation is worth following.

**BIMI: Brand Indicators for Message Identification**

BIMI is the newest authentication standard, and it's the one your marketing team will actually get excited about. BIMI displays your brand logo directly in the inbox next to your sender name. It's visual brand recognition at the point of open.

Requirements: BIMI requires DMARC enforcement (p=quarantine or p=reject), so you can't shortcut to it. You'll also need a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC), which costs roughly $1,500 per year from DigiCert or Entrust.

BIMI is currently supported by Gmail, Yahoo, and Apple Mail, which covers a substantial portion of consumer inboxes. The DNS record format is: `default._bimi.yourdomain.com` with a TXT record pointing to your logo SVG and VMC certificate.

Implement BIMI once you have DMARC at enforcement. The investment is relatively small for the brand recognition benefit, especially for consumer-facing brands competing in crowded inboxes.

**ARC: Authenticated Received Chain**

ARC preserves authentication results when emails pass through intermediary servers, like mailing lists or forwarding services. Without ARC, forwarded emails often fail DMARC because the intermediary server isn't in the original sender's SPF record.

ARC is handled at the mail server level and isn't something most marketers need to configure directly. But if you're seeing DMARC failures from forwarded emails, ARC support on your sending infrastructure is the solution.

**MTA-STS: MTA Strict Transport Security**

MTA-STS forces TLS encryption for email in transit, preventing downgrade attacks where a bad actor forces an unencrypted connection to intercept email content. Implementation requires a DNS record and a hosted policy file. It's a security enhancement worth implementing, particularly if you send sensitive information via email (order confirmations, account details, financial data).

**The authentication implementation sequence matters.** If you're setting up authentication from scratch, follow this order: SPF first (it's the simplest, one DNS record), then DKIM (slightly more complex, your ESP will provide the records), then DMARC at p=none (start monitoring), then advance DMARC to enforcement over 4 to 8 weeks. BIMI comes last, only after DMARC is at p=quarantine or p=reject.

**For multi-ESP setups, authentication gets complicated fast.** If you're using Klaviyo for marketing, SendGrid for transactional, Intercom for product emails, and Google Workspace for internal email, all four need to be covered by your SPF record and all four need DKIM configured with proper domain alignment. This is where the SPF 10-lookup limit becomes a real problem, and where SPF flattening or restructuring your setup becomes necessary.

Audit your full authentication setup quarterly. ESPs change their sending infrastructure, domains expire, and new sending sources get added without updating DNS. A quick check of your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records takes 15 minutes and can prevent deliverability problems before they start. Use dmarcian.com or postmarkapp.com/dmarc for easy DMARC monitoring and reporting.

### Sender Reputation

Your sender reputation determines whether inbox providers trust you enough to put your emails in the inbox. In 2026, the rules have shifted.

**Domain reputation now matters more than IP reputation for Gmail.** Google retired its legacy IP/Domain Reputation dashboards in September 2025, replacing them with Compliance Status and Spam Rate dashboards. This signals a broader move toward domain-level evaluation. Your domain's reputation follows you regardless of which IPs you send from.

Gmail uses approximately a 120-day reputation window. That means a serious reputation hit takes up to 4 months to fully recover from. Prevention is far less painful than cure.

**Key metrics inbox providers track:**

Bounce rates should stay below 1%. Spam complaints should stay below 0.1% (that's 1 complaint per 1,000 emails). Engagement rates (opens, clicks, replies) factor heavily into Gmail's filtering decisions. Sending patterns matter. A sudden spike from 10,000 to 100,000 emails looks like a spammer who just bought a list. Ramp up gradually.

**Use a dedicated IP when sending over 1 million emails per month.** Below that volume, shared IPs from reputable ESPs are fine and often preferable, because the ESP's overall reputation benefits your sending. Above that volume, a dedicated IP gives you full control over (and full responsibility for) your reputation.

**Troy Ericson's "Email Paramedic" approach** to reputation recovery follows a clear sequence: fix authentication first, then clean the list, then rebuild engagement with the healthiest segments. Trying to fix engagement before authentication is like mopping the floor while the pipe is still leaking.

**List hygiene and its effect on reputation:** Remove hard bounces immediately (your ESP should do this automatically). Suppress or remove subscribers who haven't engaged in 12 months. Run your list through a verification service (ZeroBounce, NeverBounce, BriteVerify) at least twice a year to catch addresses that have become invalid, converted to spam traps, or been recycled. Pristine spam traps (addresses that were never used by a real person, planted by ISPs to catch spammers) are the most damaging. They signal that you're using a purchased or scraped list. Recycled spam traps (old valid addresses that were abandoned and then repurposed) are less damaging individually but signal that you're not maintaining list hygiene.

**Engagement-based suppression is the most underused reputation tool.** Most marketers know they should remove hard bounces. Fewer realise that continuing to send to genuinely disengaged subscribers is actively harming their reputation. If someone hasn't opened or clicked any of your emails in 6 months, they're hurting your engagement rates, which hurts your Gmail reputation, which hurts your inbox placement for everyone. I'd suggest a quarterly review where you either re-engage or suppress subscribers who've been inactive for 120+ days.

### Inbox Placement vs Delivery Rate

These are two different metrics, and confusing them is a common and costly mistake.

**Delivery rate** measures the percentage of emails accepted by the receiving mail server. A 95%+ delivery rate is good. But "accepted by the server" doesn't mean "placed in the inbox." It means the server didn't outright reject it.

**Inbox placement rate** measures the percentage of delivered emails that actually land in the inbox rather than spam, junk, or the Promotions tab. An inbox placement rate of 85 to 94% is considered good.

You can have a 98% delivery rate and a 50% inbox placement rate. In that scenario, half your emails are technically "delivered" but sitting in spam where no one will ever see them.

Monitor both. Your ESP reports delivery rate. For inbox placement, you need tools like GlockApps, Validity's Everest, or seed testing via mail-tester.com.

**The Promotions tab factor.** For Gmail users, the Promotions tab is a grey area between inbox and spam. Your email is technically "delivered to the inbox," but it's in a tab most users check less frequently (or never). Whether you count Promotions tab placement as successful inbox placement depends on your business. For ecommerce brands, the Promotions tab can actually work in your favour since users browse it when they're in a shopping mindset. For B2B and relationship-driven businesses, Primary tab placement matters significantly more. Google's filtering is based heavily on engagement patterns, so consistently high engagement is your best path to the Primary tab.

### Gmail's Engagement-Based Filtering

Gmail's filtering system is the most sophisticated of any inbox provider, and understanding how it works is essential for any serious email marketer.

**Gmail seeds your initial send to a sample of recipients.** When you send a campaign, Gmail doesn't deliver all of your emails simultaneously. It sends a batch to a subset of recipients first and observes what happens.

**Gmail watches engagement signals on this initial batch.** Opens, clicks, replies, moving the email from Promotions to Primary, deleting without opening, and, most critically, marking as spam. Based on these engagement signals, Gmail makes filtering decisions for the remaining delivery.

**This is why sending to your most engaged subscribers first matters.** If your initial batch goes to disengaged subscribers who delete without opening or mark as spam, Gmail concludes that your email isn't wanted and filters the rest more aggressively. If your initial batch goes to engaged subscribers who open and click, Gmail concludes that your email is valuable and delivers the rest more favourably.

**Implement engagement-based tiering for your sends:**

Tier 1: Subscribers who clicked an email in the last 30 days. Send to this group first.
Tier 2: Subscribers who opened (but didn't click) in the last 30 days. Send 1 to 2 hours after Tier 1.
Tier 3: Subscribers who opened in the last 60 days. Send 2 to 3 hours after Tier 1.
Tier 4: Subscribers who opened in the last 90 days. Send 3 to 4 hours after Tier 1.
Tier 5: Subscribers with no engagement in 365+ days. Consider a dedicated re-engagement sequence rather than including in regular campaigns.

Not every ESP supports staggered sending by engagement tier. Klaviyo's Smart Sending and some enterprise platforms do. If yours doesn't, at minimum send campaigns only to subscribers who've engaged in the last 90 to 120 days and handle older subscribers separately.

### Warming Up Domains and IPs

When you set up a new sending domain or dedicated IP, inbox providers have no reputation data for it. you're starting from zero. Warming is the process of gradually building a positive reputation by starting small and scaling up.

**Start with your most engaged subscribers.** Your first sends should go to people who opened or clicked an email from you in the last 7 days. These subscribers are most likely to engage positively, sending the right signals to inbox providers.

**Follow a structured warming schedule:**

| Phase | Daily Volume |
|---|---|
| Days 1-3 | 50-100 |
| Days 4-7 | 200-500 |
| Week 2 | 500-1,000 |
| Week 3 | 1,000-5,000 |
| Week 4 | 5,000-10,000 |
| Week 5+ | Scale to full volume |

**Ramp up by 20 to 50% per day or week,** depending on how the warming is going. If you see bounce rates climb above 2% or spam complaints above 0.1%, slow down. If engagement is strong, push the pace.

**Monitor bounce rates, spam complaints, and inbox placement throughout the warming period.** Use Google Postmaster Tools (requires DNS verification and a minimum of 200 to 500 messages per day to generate data) to track your Gmail reputation specifically.

**Your welcome sequence is a natural warming mechanism.** New subscribers are highly engaged (they just signed up), so welcome emails naturally generate positive signals. If you're setting up a new domain, launching with a strong welcome flow and a growing list is an ideal way to warm organically.

**Common warming mistakes:**

Sending to your full list on day one. This is the most common and most damaging mistake. Inbox providers see a new domain suddenly sending 50,000 emails and immediately flag it.

Using a purchased or rented list for warming. The entire point of warming is to build positive engagement signals. Purchased lists have terrible engagement rates and often contain spam traps. You're poisoning your reputation from the start.

Ignoring negative signals during warming. If your bounce rate spikes on day 4, don't push ahead to the day 5 volume. Pause, investigate, clean, and restart. warming is not a rigid schedule. It's a feedback loop.

Warming only with transactional emails. Transactional emails (order confirmations, shipping notifications) get high engagement, which makes them tempting for warming. But inbox providers treat transactional and marketing emails differently. Warm with the type of email you'll actually be sending at scale.

**Warming a new IP vs warming a new domain:** The process is similar, but domain warming is more forgiving because domain reputation is shared across IPs. If you're moving ESPs (and therefore IPs) but keeping your domain, your existing domain reputation carries over. You'll still want to ramp up gradually, but the warming period is typically shorter because you're not starting from zero.

### Dealing with Spam Filters

In 2026, content-based spam filtering is far less important than reputation-based filtering. Modern spam filters use machine learning models that consider the full picture: sender reputation, recipient engagement history, message fingerprint similarity to known spam, and overall sending patterns.

That said, content still matters at the margins, and there are specific triggers you should be aware of.

**High-impact content triggers:**

URL reputation is the single most important content factor. If your email contains a link to a domain that's been associated with spam, phishing, or malware, your email is going to have problems regardless of your sender reputation. Audit every link in your emails.

URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.) are penalised because spammers use them to hide malicious destinations. Always use full, direct URLs. If you need tracking, use your ESP's built-in link tracking, which uses your own domain.

Image-only emails (no text, just images) are flagged because they're a classic spam tactic to evade text-based content filters. Always include a meaningful amount of text alongside your images.

Mismatched link text and URLs (where the visible text says one URL but the link goes somewhere else) are a phishing indicator. If your link text says "www.yoursite.com" but the href goes to a tracking redirect, some filters will flag it. Use descriptive link text rather than raw URLs.

**Medium-impact triggers:**

All caps, excessive punctuation (!!!), and spam-associated phrases (when combined with poor reputation) can contribute to filtering. These matter most for senders who already have borderline reputation.

**Low-impact triggers (commonly overstated):**

Individual 'spam words' like "free," "discount," or "limited time" have negligible impact when you have good sender reputation. This is one of the most persistent myths in email marketing. In the early days of spam filtering, keyword-based filters were common and these words did matter. Modern ML-based filters are far more sophisticated. A well-reputed sender using the word "free" in a relevant context will not be filtered for it.

**The List-Unsubscribe header** is worth calling out specifically. Gmail and Yahoo both require a functioning List-Unsubscribe header (including one-click unsubscribe via List-Unsubscribe-Post) for bulk senders. This was part of the requirements both providers rolled out in early 2024 for senders of 5,000+ messages per day. If you're not including this header, your emails are at higher risk of filtering. Most major ESPs add this automatically, but verify it's present by checking your email headers.

**The text-to-image ratio myth deserves clarification.** You'll find old advice saying you need a 60:40 or 80:20 text-to-image ratio. There's no specific ratio that spam filters enforce. What matters is that your email contains meaningful text content. An email that's 100% images with no text is a problem. An email that's 70% images with well-written text in between is usually fine, provided your reputation is healthy.

### Sending Identity and Infrastructure

How you structure your sending identity affects both deliverability and subscriber perception.

**Separate marketing from transactional email.** Use different subdomains: mail.yourbrand.com for marketing, transact.yourbrand.com for transactional (order confirmations, password resets, shipping notifications). This way, if your marketing reputation takes a hit, your critical transactional emails are insulated.

However, don't bother separating if you're sending fewer than 40,000 to 50,000 emails per month. At lower volumes, the operational overhead of managing two sending setups isn't justified by the marginal protection.

**From name has a significant impact on open rates.** Personal names get 3.81% more opens than brand names on average.

"George from SmartrMail" tends to outperform "SmartrMail" which tends to outperform "SmartrMail Team." The most effective format depends on context:

Personal name (just "George") works best for creator businesses, personal brands, and newsletters where the individual is the brand.

Brand name works best for established, widely recognisable brands where the individual behind the email doesn't matter to the subscriber.

"Person at Brand" format often works best for mid-size brands and SaaS, where subscribers benefit from both the personal connection and the brand context.

**Consistency in your From name matters more than which format you choose.** Don't change your From name constantly. Subscribers learn to recognise your sender name, and changing it means they have to re-learn who you are. Every change carries a risk of lower opens as subscribers fail to recognise you.

Testing your sender name is one of the highest-value tests you can run because the results compound across every email you send.

**Always set a monitored reply-to address.** Replies are positive engagement signals for inbox providers. When a subscriber replies to your email, it tells Gmail, Outlook, and others that there's a real human relationship here. no-reply@ addresses kill this signal entirely.

**Why no-reply@ is actively harmful:** It's a negative signal for ISP filtering algorithms. It eliminates reply engagement, one of your strongest deliverability signals. It frustrates customers who want to respond. And it violates the fundamental spirit of email as a two-way communication medium.

**Set up a branded sending domain instead of using your ESP's default.** When you send through your ESP's shared domain, you're sharing reputation with every other sender on that domain. You have no control over their practices, and their mistakes affect your deliverability. You also can't enforce DMARC on a domain you don't own, and your emails lack brand recognition in the sender details.

Set up a branded sending domain once your database exceeds 5,000 profiles. Below that, the shared domain is acceptable. Above it, the investment in a branded domain pays for itself in improved deliverability and brand recognition.

**The reply-to strategy in practice:** Set your reply-to to an email address that's actively monitored. This can be a shared inbox (support@yourbrand.com), a personal address (george@yourbrand.com), or a dedicated address (hello@yourbrand.com). The key is that someone reads and responds to replies. When subscribers hit reply and get a bounce-back or silence, you lose the engagement signal and the trust.

Some marketers go further and actively encourage replies. "Hit reply and tell me your biggest challenge with email marketing" in a welcome email serves double duty: it collects valuable customer insight and it generates positive engagement signals that improve your deliverability. I know several newsletter operators who attribute their consistently strong inbox placement partly to the volume of replies they receive.

**Subdomain strategy for larger organisations:**

For brands sending at significant scale (100,000+ per month), use a more detailed subdomain structure:

- mail.yourbrand.com for marketing campaigns
- news.yourbrand.com for newsletters
- transact.yourbrand.com for transactional emails
- auto.yourbrand.com for automated flows (welcome, abandoned cart)

each subdomain builds its own reputation, so a problem with your marketing campaigns doesn't bleed into your transactional or automated sending. This level of separation is overkill for most small and mid-size businesses, but essential for larger operations.

### Feedback Loops

Feedback loops (FBLs) are mechanisms that inbox providers use to notify you when a recipient marks your email as spam.

**Yahoo/AOL FBL** sends you ARF (Abuse Reporting Format) reports whenever a recipient clicks "Report Spam" on your email. Register for this at the Yahoo/AOL sender hub.

**Microsoft JMRP (Junk Mail Reporting Programme)** provides the same for Outlook.com, Hotmail, and other Microsoft consumer email addresses.

**Gmail does not offer a traditional FBL.** Instead, Gmail uses the Feedback-ID header (which your ESP typically sets automatically) combined with aggregate spam rate data in Google Postmaster Tools. You won't get individual complaint reports from Gmail, only aggregate percentages.

**The critical process: immediately suppress any email address that generates a spam complaint.** Don't wait. Don't send them one more email. Don't add them to a "re-engagement" sequence. Remove them from all future sends. Continuing to email someone who has reported you as spam is the fastest way to damage your reputation.

### ISP Throttling

When you send too much email too fast to a single inbox provider, they may throttle your delivery. Understanding the response codes is essential.

**4xx response codes are temporary rejections.** They mean "slow down, try again later." Common 4xx codes include 421 (too many connections), 450 (mailbox unavailable, try later), and 452 (too many recipients). The correct response is to implement exponential backoff: wait, then retry, doubling the wait time with each retry.

**5xx response codes are permanent rejections.** They mean "stop, this isn't going to work." Common 5xx codes include 550 (mailbox doesn't exist), 551 (user not local), 552 (message too large), and 553 (invalid address). The correct response is to remove the address or fix the underlying issue.

**Don't open more than 10 to 20 simultaneous connections to a single ISP.** Opening too many connections looks like a spam attack and will trigger throttling or blocking.

Most modern ESPs handle throttling automatically, adjusting sending speed based on ISP responses. But if you're managing your own mail infrastructure, or if you're troubleshooting deliverability issues, understanding these response codes matters.

**Common ISP-specific throttling patterns:**

Gmail tends to throttle with 421 errors during warming periods and will defer delivery for hours or even days if it detects a pattern it doesn't like. The fix is always the same: slow down and improve engagement quality.

Microsoft (Outlook.com, Hotmail) uses a tiered throttling system. You might send successfully to most recipients but see blocks for a subset. Microsoft also uses its own Smart Network Data Services portal where you can check your sending IP's reputation and apply for mitigation if you've been blocked.

Yahoo/AOL tend to be more aggressive about rate limiting during warming. They're also more sensitive to burst sending (sending a large volume in a very short window). Spread your sends over a longer period when targeting Yahoo/AOL-heavy segments.

### Domain Reputation Monitoring Tools

You can't fix what you can't see. Here are the tools worth using for monitoring your sending reputation.

**Google Postmaster Tools** is free and essential. It requires DNS verification to set up and needs a minimum of 200 to 500 messages per day to Gmail recipients to generate usable data. It shows your domain reputation status, spam rate, authentication success rates, and encryption percentage.

**Microsoft SNDS (Smart Network Data Services)** provides IP-level reputation data for Outlook.com and related Microsoft email properties. Less granular than Google Postmaster but important if you have significant Outlook audience.

**Cisco Talos Intelligence** checks your IP and domain reputation against Cisco's threat database. Cisco powers filtering for a large number of corporate email gateways.

**Barracuda Reputation System** shows your status on Barracuda's widely-used spam filter. Many businesses use Barracuda appliances or cloud services for email security.

**MXToolbox** checks your domain against over 100 blocklists simultaneously. It's the quickest way to identify if you've been listed on any major blocklist.

**Sender Score by Validity** assigns your sending IP a score from 0 to 100. Above 80 is good. Below 70 indicates problems. It's a useful at-a-glance metric, though it's IP-based rather than domain-based.

### Step-by-Step Deliverability Diagnosis Framework

When your emails stop reaching the inbox, work through this framework systematically. Skipping steps almost always leads to wasted effort.

**Step 1: Identify the symptom.** What exactly is happening? Lower inbox placement? Higher bounce rates? Throttling from specific providers? Is the problem affecting all inbox providers or just one (usually Gmail)?  Getting specific about the symptom directs your investigation.

**Step 2: Check authentication.** Are SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all passing? Check your recent DMARC reports. Verify with an authentication testing tool (mail-tester.com, MXToolbox). Also check your PTR (reverse DNS) record, which validates that your sending IP resolves back to your domain. Authentication failures are the most common and most easily fixable cause of deliverability problems.

**Step 3: Check blocklists.** Search your sending IPs and domain across major blocklists: Spamhaus (the most influential), Barracuda, SpamCop, and SURBL (which checks URLs within emails, not just sender IPs). If you're listed, you need to fix the root cause before requesting delisting.

**Step 4: Check reputation.** Use Google Postmaster Tools, Microsoft SNDS, Cisco Talos, and Sender Score to assess your current reputation. If reputation has dropped, identify when it started declining and correlate with your sending activity.

**Step 5: Analyse bounce logs.** Export your bounce data and categorise by type (hard bounce, soft bounce, block) and by ISP. Patterns will emerge. If all your bounces are from Gmail, that's a Gmail-specific problem. If they're across all providers, the issue is more fundamental.

**Step 6: Review sending patterns.** Did you recently spike volume? Send to an old, un-engaged segment? Change your email template significantly? Import a new list? Any of these can trigger filtering.

**Step 7: Check content.** Is there a bad URL in your emails? A link to a domain with poor reputation? URL shorteners? An image-only email? A missing List-Unsubscribe header? Content issues are less common than reputation issues in 2026, but they still matter at the margins.

**Step 8: Test and validate.** Use seed list testing (GlockApps, InboxReady) to measure actual inbox placement across providers. Use mail-tester.com to score your email and identify specific issues. These tools tell you where you're landing and why.

**Step 9: Remediate.** Fix the root cause before doing anything else. If you're on a blocklist because of a spam trap hit, clean your list before requesting delisting. If your reputation dropped because of a high-volume send to disengaged subscribers, restrict your sending to engaged subscribers before trying to rebuild.

**Step 10: Monitor recovery.** Reputation recovery takes time. Expect 2 to 4 weeks for noticeable improvement in most cases. Full Gmail reputation recovery can take up to 120 days due to their extended reputation window. Be patient, continue sending to engaged subscribers, and track your Postmaster Tools data weekly.

**When to call in a specialist.** If you've worked through this entire framework and your deliverability hasn't improved after 4 weeks, it may be time to engage a deliverability consultant. Specialists like Troy Ericson, Laura Atkins (Word to the Wise), and the teams at Validity and Kickbox have deep relationships with ISPs and can escalate issues that self-service approaches can't resolve. deliverability consulting typically runs $2,000 to $10,000 depending on the complexity of the issue, but the revenue impact of poor deliverability usually dwarfs that cost.

**Proactive deliverability monitoring should be part of your weekly routine.** Set aside 15 minutes every Monday to check: Google Postmaster Tools spam rate and compliance status, bounce rates from your last week of sends, any new blocklist appearances via MXToolbox, and your overall engagement trends (open rate, click rate, unsubscribe rate). Catching a problem in week one, before it becomes a crisis, is far easier than trying to recover after a month of declining reputation.

## Chapter 8: Testing and Optimisation

The difference between a good email programme and a great one is rarely a single big idea. It's hundreds of small improvements, compounding over months and years. Testing is how you find those improvements. Optimisation is how you bank them.

### What to Test

Not everything is worth testing. Focus your testing effort on changes that will have the biggest impact on your key metrics and, ideally, that will compound across future sends.

**Subject lines** are the most commonly tested element, and for good reason. But test one variable at a time. Don't test a short subject line with an emoji against a long one without. You won't know which variable caused the difference. Test length in one experiment. Personalisation in another. Question vs statement in another. Emoji vs no emoji in another.

**Send time** is underrated as a test variable. The same email sent at 6am vs 2pm can show dramatically different results. Send Time Optimisation (STO) platforms automate this at the individual level, but even a simple test of morning vs afternoon for your audience can reveal significant opportunities.

**CTAs** are high-impact test candidates. Button vs text link, button colour, button copy, and button position all affect click-through rates. A CTA test that produces a 10% improvement benefits every email that uses that CTA format going forward.

**Content and layout** testing reveals whether your audience prefers long-form or short-form emails, image-heavy or text-heavy layouts, and one topic or multiple topics per send.

**Sender name** is one of the highest-value tests you can run. Because the sender name appears on every email you send, even a small improvement in open rate from a sender name change compounds across all future sends. Test personal name vs brand name vs "person at brand" format.

**The 'ugly email' test.** Take your beautifully designed HTML template and test it against a plain-text version with no images, no styling, just words. I've seen multiple case studies where the plain-text version wins in B2B contexts, sometimes significantly. It's humbling, but it's data.

**Removing the hero image.** Several case studies have shown that removing the large hero image from the top of an email improves click-through rates. The email loads faster, looks more personal, and the CTA moves above the fold. it's worth testing for your audience.

**Preheader text vs no preheader text.** This is one of the lowest-risk, highest-reward tests you can run. If you're not currently using intentional preview text, test adding it. The data consistently shows a lift, and the implementation takes about 30 seconds.

**Email length.** Test a 100-word email against a 400-word email with the same offer and CTA. You may find that shorter emails produce higher click rates (less to read before the CTA) or that longer emails produce higher conversion rates (more context builds more desire). The answer depends on your audience, your offer, and the complexity of what you're selling. Simple products tend to benefit from shorter copy. Complex, high-consideration purchases tend to benefit from more detail.

**Testing priority framework:** Rank potential tests by two factors: expected impact (how much could this improve results?) and compounding effect (how many future sends will benefit?). Tests with both high impact and high compounding should always be prioritised. Sender name, CTA format, and email template structure top that list. Subject line tests have high impact but low compounding since each subject line is unique.

### Statistical Significance

Most marketers run A/B tests incorrectly. They check results after a few hours, see that one version is "winning," and declare a winner based on incomplete data. This leads to implementing changes that were actually just random noise.

**Only about 1 in 7 A/B tests produces a statistically significant winner.** That means 6 out of 7 tests end in a draw where neither version is meaningfully better. This is normal. It means most of your current practices are already pretty good, and big wins are found at the margins.

**Sample size guidelines:**

For small lists (under 5,000 subscribers), test 20 to 30% of your list. You need a larger sample proportion because the total numbers are small.

For medium lists (5,000 to 50,000), test 15 to 25%.

For large lists (50,000+), test 10 to 20%. You can use a smaller proportion because the absolute numbers are large enough for significance.

**Wait times for reliable results:**

For open rate tests, 2 hours of data predicts the winner with 80%+ accuracy. Most opens happen within the first 2 hours of delivery.

For revenue-based tests, let the test run for a full day to achieve 90% accuracy. Revenue takes longer to materialise as subscribers click through, browse, and eventually purchase.

**Always send both test versions at the same time on the same day.** Sending version A on Tuesday and version B on Wednesday doesn't test your variable. It tests the day of the week.

**Use a significance calculator.** Don't eyeball it. Tools like VWO's A/B test significance calculator, Evan Miller's calculator, or your ESP's built-in significance indicator will tell you whether your result is statistically reliable. Most calculators use a 95% confidence level, meaning there's only a 5% chance the observed difference is due to random chance. Don't declare a winner below 95% confidence.

**Bayesian vs frequentist testing.** Some platforms (including Klaviyo and Optimizely) use Bayesian statistics rather than traditional frequentist methods. Bayesian testing gives you a probability that one version is better than the other (e.g., "Version A has a 92% probability of being the winner"), which many people find more intuitive than p-values and confidence intervals. Either approach is valid. What matters is that you use one of them rather than guessing.

### A/B Test Surprises

Some of the most instructive test results are the ones nobody expected.

The Obama campaign's "Hey" subject line raising $2.5 million more than its nearest competitor remains the most cited example. The campaign's email team was shocked. They assumed casual, personal subject lines wouldn't work for political fundraising. They were wrong.

Negative subject lines can outperform positive ones. "Don't make this mistake with your email" can beat "How to improve your email." Loss aversion at work.

Dell tested a GIF vs a static image in a product email. The animated GIF showing the product in use generated 109% more revenue than the static image. The lesson: showing a product in action, even in a simple animation, helps the buyer visualise ownership.

Removing hero images from emails has improved open-to-click rates in multiple documented case studies. The large hero image that feels essential to the design team can actually be a barrier to engagement.

Adding preview text consistently produces roughly 5% higher open rates. It's one of the simplest, most reliable improvements you can make.

Perhaps the most counterintuitive finding: reducing email frequency sometimes increases total revenue. How? By improving inbox placement. When you send less frequently but to more engaged recipients, inbox providers reward you with better placement, and the emails you do send perform significantly better. More isn't always more.

**Multivariate testing vs A/B testing.** A/B testing compares two versions with one variable changed. Multivariate testing changes multiple variables simultaneously and measures how different combinations perform. Multivariate is appealing because it's faster in theory, testing many things at once. In practice, it requires much larger sample sizes to reach significance because you're splitting traffic across many more variants. For most email lists under 100,000, stick to A/B testing. Multivariate testing becomes practical only at significant scale.

### Continuous Improvement

Testing without a system is just random experimentation. You need a process.

**Jeanne Jennings' systematic approach** is the one I'd recommend: analyse your current performance to identify the weakest link, form a hypothesis about what might improve it, test that hypothesis with a proper A/B test, apply the winning variant, and repeat. The key word is systematic. Each test builds on the learnings of the previous one.

**Build a testing calendar.** Gavin Laugenie advocates for quarterly testing plans tied to business questions. Don't test for the sake of testing. Start with a question: "Is our sender name costing us opens?" or "Would a shorter email increase clicks?" Then design a test to answer it. Document results in a shared location so institutional knowledge accumulates.

**Beware over-testing.** If you're running multiple tests simultaneously, or changing too many variables at once, you'll struggle to attribute results and you risk fatiguing your list. One well-designed test per send is enough.

**The compounding effect of optimisation is where the real value lives.** a 2% improvement in your welcome series open rate might seem trivial. But that improvement affects every single new subscriber from now until you change it again. Over thousands of subscribers and months of sending, a 2% improvement in a foundational flow translates to meaningful revenue.

**Prioritise testing your automated flows over campaigns.** Campaign tests improve a single send. Flow tests improve every send through that flow from now on. If you have limited testing capacity, focus it on your welcome series, your abandoned cart sequence, and your post-purchase follow-up. These are your highest-volume, highest-value flows, and improvements compound indefinitely.

**Document everything in a testing log.** At minimum, record: what you tested, the hypothesis, sample sizes for each variant, results with confidence level, the date, and what you decided to implement. Over time, this log becomes one of the most valuable assets in your email programme. It prevents you from re-testing things you've already tested, and it reveals patterns across tests that individual results might miss.

### Send Time Optimisation

Send Time Optimisation (STO) uses data about each subscriber's past engagement to predict the optimal time to deliver each email. Instead of blasting your entire list at 10am on Tuesday, STO queues each email for the moment that specific subscriber is most likely to engage.

**How it works:** The platform tracks when each subscriber has historically opened and clicked emails. It builds a per-subscriber model of engagement patterns (morning person, lunchtime checker, late-night browser) and queues delivery accordingly. For new subscribers with insufficient engagement data, the platform typically falls back to audience-level averages until enough individual data accumulates.

**Platform comparison:**

| Platform | Feature | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Klaviyo | Smart Send Time | ML per individual |
| Seventh Sense | AI Send Time | Deep per-contact analysis |
| ActiveCampaign | Predictive Sending | Per-contact patterns |
| Mailchimp | STO | Audience-level (not individual) |
| Brevo | STO | Per-contact prediction |

Here's more context on each:

Klaviyo's Smart Send Time uses machine learning to predict optimal delivery at the individual subscriber level. It's available on most plans and works well for ecommerce.

Seventh Sense offers the deepest per-contact analysis and integrates with HubSpot and Marketo. It's the most sophisticated option for B2B and enterprise.

ActiveCampaign's Predictive Sending builds per-contact patterns and optimises delivery timing. Good option for small to mid-size B2B.

Mailchimp's Send Time Optimisation works at the audience level, not individual level. It finds the best time for your audience as a whole, which is less precise but still better than guessing.

Brevo's STO offers per-contact prediction and is included in their marketing platform.

**Results:** STO typically delivers a 5 to 15% improvement in open rates. That's a substantial lift for a feature that requires zero additional work after setup.

**When STO doesn't help:**

Time-sensitive content. If your email is about a flash sale ending in 4 hours, you can't drip it out over 24 hours. Some messages need to arrive at a specific time.

Small lists under 1,000. The models need enough data to find patterns. With very small lists, the predictions aren't reliable enough to outperform informed guessing.

Transactional emails. Order confirmations, password resets, and shipping notifications should arrive immediately. Delaying them for "optimal engagement time" would frustrate customers.

**General timing findings from broad data:**

Emails sent between 4am and 6am tend to produce the highest open rates, because they're sitting at the top of the inbox when the subscriber wakes up and checks their phone. This doesn't mean 4am is the right send time for your audience, but it explains why early morning sends often outperform midday ones.

Tuesday and Thursday tend to be the best-performing days for B2B email. Monday inboxes are crowded from the weekend. Friday attention has already shifted to the weekend. Midweek hits the sweet spot.

For B2C and ecommerce, weekends can actually outperform weekdays for certain verticals (fashion, food, entertainment) because subscribers have more leisure browsing time.

But here's the real takeaway: these are generalisations. Your audience is specific. STO tools exist because the "best" send time varies not just by audience, but by individual. Use the general findings as a starting point, then let the data and the algorithms refine from there.

**Time zone handling is the often-forgotten cousin of send time optimisation.** If your audience spans multiple time zones (and if you have any international subscribers, it does), sending at 10am in your time zone means some subscribers receive it at 3am. Most ESPs offer time zone-based sending that delivers at the same local time for each subscriber. It's not as precise as full STO, but it's a significant step up from blasting everything at once. For globally distributed audiences, time zone sending is table stakes before you even consider STO.

### Building a Testing Culture

The most successful email programmes I've worked with share a common trait: they treat every send as a learning opportunity, not just a broadcast. They ask "what did we learn?" as often as "how did it perform?"

This means documenting test results where the team can find them. It means celebrating negative results (learning that something doesn't work is valuable). It means allocating time and sends specifically for testing rather than filling every slot with revenue-focused campaigns.

Dedicate at least 20% of your campaign sends to testing something. Not every test will produce a winner. But over the course of a year, the wins that do emerge will compound into a programme that performs meaningfully better than where you started.

**Share test results across teams.** Your email testing insights don't exist in a vacuum. A subject line test that reveals your audience responds better to negative framing has implications for your ad copy, your landing page headlines, and your product messaging. A CTA test that shows first-person copy outperforms second-person applies everywhere you're writing calls to action. email testing is often the fastest, cheapest way to learn about your audience's preferences because the feedback loop is so tight.

**When a test fails to produce a winner.** Inconclusive results are still results. They tell you that the variable you tested doesn't matter much to your audience, which frees you to stop worrying about it and focus your optimisation energy elsewhere. If you tested button colour and found no significant difference between red and green, you now know that button colour isn't a lever for you. Move on to something that is.

Testing isn't a phase. It's a practice.
