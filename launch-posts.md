## 1. Twitter/X Long-Form Post

I spent 4 months building something I wish existed when I was running SmartrMail.

The Email Marketing Bible: 55,000 words across 16 chapters, built from 908 sources and 4,798 extracted insights. Every claim backed by data. No fluff. No filler. No "it depends."

It covers everything:
- Fundamentals and benchmarks
- List building that actually works
- Segmentation and personalisation
- The automated flows that make money (welcome, abandoned cart, post-purchase, win-back)
- Copywriting frameworks from practitioners who've generated $200M+ in email revenue
- Design and technical (including accessibility)
- Deliverability (the stuff that actually determines whether your emails get seen)
- Testing and optimisation
- Analytics and measurement
- Compliance (GDPR, CAN-SPAM, CASL. The stuff you can't afford to get wrong)
- 19 industry-specific playbooks
- Platform selection (honest breakdown, no affiliate links)
- Cold email (separate chapter because the rules are completely different)
- AI and email (what's working now vs what's hype)
- Company case studies (Morning Brew, Charity: Water, Dollar Shave Club, and more)

44 of the best email marketing practitioners in the world are cited throughout. People like Kath Pay, Chase Dimond, Joanna Wiebe, Troy Ericson, Andre Chaperon, Ben Settle, Dan Oshinsky, and Ian Brodie.

But I wanted to make it actionable. So I also built it as a Claude Code skill.

Install it, and Claude becomes an email marketing co-pilot. It can audit your setup, draft sequences, pull benchmarks for your industry, identify gaps in your flows, and give you data-backed recommendations, all grounded in 908 real sources instead of generic AI hallucinations.

One command to install:
claude install-skill https://github.com/CosmoBlk/email-marketing-bible

The full guide is live, open-source, and free to download now:
https://emailmarketingskill.com

The GitHub repo:
https://github.com/CosmoBlk/email-marketing-bible

I built SmartrMail (email marketing for ecommerce w 12K customers). I've seen what works and what doesn't across thousands of real accounts and 10 billion sent emails. This guide is the distillation of all of that plus the best thinking from 44 practitioners who've collectively driven billions in email revenue.

If you do email marketing, or build tools for people who do, this is the reference I wish someone had handed me on day one.

**Maker Comment (first comment after launch):**

Hey PH! I'm George. I built SmartrMail (email marketing for ecommerce, 28K customers) and I now run a modern reading start-up called Obooko.

Here's the backstory on why I made the Email Marketing Bible/Skill.

I love email. I've spent a decade in email marketing, building tools, studying what works across thousands of real accounts, obsessing over deliverability and flows and subject lines. Email is still the highest-ROI channel in marketing and it's not even close.

When I started Obooko, I automated almost everything. Content creation, social scheduling, analytics, customer support workflows. Claude handles most of it for me. But email marketing was the one thing I couldn't properly automate. There are 2 problems: 1) the current email marketing tools don't connect well to AI as they're fundamentally built human first, with an API added. Secondly, AI doesn't actually know email marketing nuance. Ask it to write a welcome sequence and you get generic, unsourced fluff. Ask about deliverability and it confidently makes things up.

I decided I couldn't fix 1 (ESPs not playing nicely with Claude and MCP), but I could fix 2 by building a comprehensive knowledge base. I pulled every credible source I could find, cross-referencing everything, cutting the fluff. 908 sources and 4,798 extracted insights later, I had 55,000 words across 16 chapters. I reached out to 44 of the best email marketing practitioners in the world and got their feedback. People like Kath Pay, Chase Dimond, Andre Chaperon, Joanna Wiebe, Dan Oshinsky, Ian Brodie.

Then I thought, why keep this to myself? Why not make it a proper Claude Code skill that anyone can install?

One command to install:
```
claude install-skill https://github.com/CosmoBlk/email-marketing-bible
```
The reason there's a separate "bible" (EMB) and a skill is AI context window. The full guide is ~55K words, too large to load into every conversation. The skill is a static, condensed extract (key stats, frameworks, benchmarks, expert names) derived from the EMB. No API or live link, just one markdown file that fits in context. When you ask Claude an email question, it uses that distilled knowledge. The bible is the canonical guide (and free website); the skill is the same material trimmed so Claude can use it without blowing the context window.

Now Claude can actually audit your email setup, draft sequences based on what practitioners who've driven hundreds of millions in email revenue actually recommend, pull real benchmarks for your industry, and give you sourced answers instead of hallucinations.

The full guide is also a free website, so no paywall, no email gate, no affiliate links: https://emailmarketingskill.com

I'd genuinely love your feedback. What's missing? What could be sharper? I'm actively incorporating expert feedback and this is a living document.

If you do email marketing, or build AI tools for marketers, I hope this is useful.

## 5. Notes for George

**Product Hunt setup:**
- George needs to create the PH listing himself (account login required)
- Schedule for Friday 21 Feb or Saturday 22 Feb (weekends can work well for dev tools)
- The Obooko PH thread with Aine is fully resolved — no reply needed
- PH contact email: hello@producthunt.com

**Product Hunt best practices (from research):**
- **3+ gallery images** at 1270×760 — each image should focus on ONE idea, not cram everything in
- **53% of Products of the Day include a video** — even a 60-second screen recording helps
- **70% of top products have a maker first comment** — post it immediately after launch
- **Maker comment formula:** What it does → why it exists → invite to engage
- **For AI tools:** "People assume vaporware — your job is clarity." Show it working.
- **Comparable launches to study:**
  - Skillkit (Feb 2026): 245 upvotes, #3 POTD — https://www.producthunt.com/products/skillkit-2

2. Terminal screenshot of the skill in action (Claude answering an email marketing question with sourced data)
3. Chapter overview / table of contents showing breadth

**Video idea (optional but recommended):**
- 60-second screen recording: install skill → ask Claude a question → show sourced answer
- Or: scroll through the website showing chapter depth, then cut to terminal demo

**Startmate/Founders Slack:**
- Post in relevant channels on launch day (Thu 20 Feb)
- Angle: "Just launched this — open-source email marketing guide + Claude Code skill"
- Ask for upvotes on PH if it's live by then

**Website prep before launch (from plan.md):**
- Remove "DRAFT — Don't Share" marquee banner from Hero.astro
- Hook up or remove Resend email capture
- Final link check on emailmarketingskill.com
- Verify GitHub README install instructions
