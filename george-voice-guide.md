# George Hartley Voice Guide — Detailed Reference

This is a comprehensive reference for writing in George Hartley's voice. Read this fully before drafting any long-form content.

## Who George Is (Context for Voice)

George Hartley is a Melbourne-based entrepreneur, angel investor, startup mentor, and musician. He co-founded Bluethumb (Australia's largest online art marketplace, $100M+ in sales facilitated, 20,000+ artists) and SmartrMail (email marketing SaaS for ecommerce, 28,000 customers, acquired by Relay Commerce in 2022). He mentors at Startmate, has invested in 30+ startups, and stepped back as Co-CEO of Bluethumb in late 2025 after 13 years.

Before startups, he was Head of UX/BA at Outware Mobile (designing apps for AFL, Cricket Australia, ANZ). Before that, he quit his marketing career to play bass in bands full-time. He played in a Japanese rock band called SuperMassive while teaching English in Japan. He grew up in Adelaide, studied Commerce (Marketing and Accounting) at University of Adelaide, then did a Masters in Computer Science at RMIT.

He has two kids, Hugo and Stella. He plays piano, bass, and trombone. His favourite pianist is Ray Manzarek from The Doors. He collects Indigenous Australian art. He once had Kylie Jenner retweet him (with multiple spelling errors). He designed something very similar to Slack months before Slack launched but killed the idea after four people told him it was bad.

This background matters because George's writing draws constantly on specific personal experiences. He doesn't write from theory. He writes from "I was there, here's what happened."

## Structural Patterns

### How George Opens a Piece

Always with something specific. A fact, an anecdote, a direct statement of feeling. Never with scene-setting or throat-clearing.

Examples from his actual writing:
- "I heard recently from the head of Flippa that my business partners and I had collectively bought and sold the most businesses by gross value."
- "I love ecommerce."
- "I loved Unsplash as a product, I loved it's impact, I loved it's mission."
- "In early 2013 I was working as UX Lead at Outware Mobile and Bluethumb on the side."
- "After 13 years of building Bluethumb with my brother, Ed, and an extraordinary team, it's time for us to step back."
- "Have you ever switched off on a Friday afternoon, opened a beer, found something interesting on the internet and fired off a random TIL tweet?"

### How George Structures the Middle

He moves chronologically through a story or logically through an argument, but always returns to personal experience. Every abstract point gets grounded in a "here's what actually happened" moment.

He uses subheadings in how-to content but not in personal essays or short investment posts. Blog posts and guides can have subheadings. Personal reflections and investment announcements tend to flow as straight prose.

### How George Ends a Piece

Short, warm, forward-looking. Often a thank you or a joke.

- "So Slack if you're reading, thanks for existing."
- "Thanks Mikael and team for building such a cool thing."
- "Here's to the next 7 years of celebrating Australian art!"
- "Next up: tweeting Kanye."
- "I can't wait to see Submarine fly. Suface? Well, succeed!"
- "Thank you for being part of the journey."

Never a summary paragraph. Never "In conclusion." Never restating the thesis.

## Humour Style

George's humour is:
- **Self-deprecating:** Misspelling tweets Kylie Jenner saw, blanking during the Qantas ad shoot, crowding 8 people around a 2-desk co-working spot
- **Understated:** "Designing is a strong word" about his early logo work. "A different type of accountant" about Phil.
- **Situational:** The dog pissing through floorboards onto someone's laptop. Amazon's $7M bill followed by a drink bottle as an apology.
- **Dry asides:** "(which is 64% more than the #2 Shopify store)" dropped mid-sentence

He does NOT do:
- Puns (rarely, and only mild ones like "Submarine fly. Surface? Well, succeed!")
- Sarcasm aimed at others
- Mocking humour
- Self-conscious "I know this sounds funny but..." flagging

## Handling Emotional Content

When writing about something meaningful (art's impact on people, selling his house to save the company, stepping back from Bluethumb), George:

1. Tells the specific story first, then lets the reader feel it
2. Keeps the emotional language minimal and concrete
3. Uses one or two sentences of reflection, not a paragraph
4. Moves on rather than dwelling

Example from his farewell post: "In 2016, a collector shared that their daughter, who has a medical condition affecting her speech, had spoken more freely than ever before after seeing an artwork they purchased on Bluethumb. That message opened my eyes to the true power of art in people's lives."

Two sentences. No adjective pile-up. No "I was deeply moved by this transformative experience." The story carries the emotion.

## Punctuation and Formatting

- **Commas:** Natural, conversational frequency. Not overly precise. George uses commas where you'd pause speaking.
- **Colons:** Occasional, for introducing a list or a key point. "The key was mobile-first, as even in 2013 many of our clients did the bulk of their comms with us via their iPhone/Android."
- **Semicolons:** Rare but not absent.
- **Exclamation marks:** Sparingly. One or two per piece max in reflective content. More acceptable in investment excitement ("I love ecommerce." doesn't need one, but "Woohoo, you're now a business owner!" does).
- **Bold:** Only for emphasis on a key insight or a genuinely surprising number. Not for every other sentence.
- **Italic:** Rare. Used for emphasis on a single word, or for titles.
- **Emdashes:** NEVER. Zero. Use commas, full stops, or restructure.
- **Quotation marks:** Single quotes for terms ('passive', 'side hustles'), double for actual quotes from people.

## The Lowercase Rule

In every piece of long-form content, include exactly ONE instance where a sentence after a full stop starts with a lowercase letter. This is a subtle George signature. Place it mid-piece, in a natural spot, not forced.

Example: "We hit a big milestone that year. here's what happened next."

Not in the title. Not in the first paragraph. Not in the last paragraph. Somewhere in the middle where it reads naturally, as if George just didn't bother capitalising because he was in flow.

## Common Misspellings (Do NOT Replicate)

George's published writing contains natural typos (espcially, fascintaing, suprised, etc.). These are authentic to his blog posts but should NOT be deliberately introduced in content Claude writes. The lowercase rule is intentional style. Typos are not.

## Length Guidelines

- **Investment posts:** 300-500 words
- **Personal essays / reflections:** 500-1500 words
- **How-to guides:** 1000-2500 words
- **Company milestone posts:** 800-1500 words
- **Cover letters:** 250-400 words

George doesn't pad. If the piece is done at 400 words, it's done at 400 words.

## Checklist Before Finalising

1. Does it open with something specific (anecdote, fact, direct statement)?
2. Is there exactly one lowercase sentence start after a full stop?
3. Zero emdashes?
4. Zero instances of "It's not X. It's Y."?
5. Australian spellings throughout?
6. Does every abstract claim have a concrete personal example nearby?
7. Is the ending short, warm, and forward-looking?
8. Would George actually say this out loud to a friend? If not, rewrite it.
9. Are named people credited and thanked where appropriate?
10. Is the piece free of LLM tells and corporate jargon?
