## What's Been Done

1. **Research phase** — Completed across 12 research sprints covering all major email marketing topics
2. **EMB v4 compilation** — All research synthesised into 16 chapters + appendices (~59K words)
3. **4-part file split** — Document split for manageability (Part 1: Intro+Ch1-4, Part 2: Ch5-8, Part 3: Ch9-11, Part 4: Ch12-16+Appendices)

---

## What's Next

See `plan.md` for the detailed roadmap. Summary:

1. **🔜 EMB v4 Expert Edit** — Fresh, from-first-principles edit of the entire document. Three goals: tighten the writing, ensure George's voice is consistent, and make every section earn its place. Document can shrink from 59K to whatever length serves readers best. Quality over quantity.

2. **EMB Skill File** — Convert the edited EMB v4 into a Claude Code SKILL.md file that can be installed and used as an AI email marketing co-pilot.

## Key Decisions & Context

- **George's voice:** Direct, practical, data-driven. Australian English. No fluff. Speaks from experience (SmartrMail, 28K customers). See the george-tone skill for reference.
- **Document philosophy:** Every claim backed by data. Every recommendation tested by practitioners. Specific things you can implement this week.
- **40 experts referenced** throughout — full directory in Chapter 16.
- **Open source:** Research crawler at [github.com/CosmoBlk/emb-research](https://github.com/CosmoBlk/emb-research)
- **Target format:** Both standalone reading AND Claude Code skill consumption.
- **The edit can reduce word count** — 59K may be too long. The expert edit should cut ruthlessly where needed. Better to be 35K brilliant words than 59K adequate ones.
